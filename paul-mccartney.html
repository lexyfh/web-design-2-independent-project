    <h1>Paul McCartney</h1>

    <section class="about-paul">
      <p>“Paul is dead” is a conspiracy theory that emerged in 1969 stating that Paul McCartney was not the real Paul McCartney. According to the theory, he died in a car crash in 1966 and the Beatles replaced him with a perfect imposter named Billy Shears who looked, acted, and sounded like McCartney. Funny enough, he was greatly entertained by this theory but also called it a stupid rumor. As many fandoms usually do, his fans became obsessed with finding out clues about the theory with their knowledge and investigations. On the cover of the Beatles album, Stg pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band, Paul is wearing a patch on his arm that appears to say OPD, also known as officially pronounced dead, but it actually is the patch for Ontario’s Police Department, the OPP. Another clue fans found was on their album, The White Album, in the song, Revolution 9, they say, “Number nine, number nine” which if played backward says, “Turn me on, dead man”. Another backward message between the tracks “I’m so Tired” and “Blackbird”, John Lennon allegedly says, “Paul is dead man, miss him miss him”. At the end of the track “Strawberry Fields Forever”, you can hear John Lennon supposedly saying, “I buried Paul” but he was actually saying “cranberry sauce”. Some of the biggest clues fans found was in the album “Abbey Road”. They came up with the concept behind the album set that it was a funeral procession, John is the preacher as he is wearing white, Ringo is the undertaker because he is dressed in black, George is the gravedigger because he is wearing blue jeans, and Paul is—well, dead because he is wearing black, out of step with the others barefoot, and pointing his cigarette down (a sign of mourning in Sicily). In the background the license plate on the car says 28IF, fans believe it was intentional, meaning Paul would be 28 if he hadn’t passed. This theory is one of the more abstract ones that fans have created, it is highly unlikely that it is real but I mean, who am I to judge, believe what you want!
