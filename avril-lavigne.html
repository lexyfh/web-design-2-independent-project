    <h1>Avril Lavigne</h1>

    <section>
      <p>Beloved pop-punk singer Avril Lavigne is a large topic within the celebrity imposter world. The theory revolves around her supposed death in 2003 where she was replaced with an actress named Melissa Vandella. This theory originates from a Brazillian blog post in 2011 called “Avril Está Morta” which translates to “Avril is Dead” which states that Avril died and was replaced. It gained a lot of attention in 2017, reporters even started asking the singer about the theory but she shut it down calling it an internet rumor and that she can’t believe people bought it. The internet became slightly obsessed with this theory and even started to claim that her facial features and style have changed, and people found hints “proving” the theory in her lyrics. But it’s a bit of a stretch picking out randomly scattered letters in a song to spell out “I am Melissa”. While this theory is quite the stretch and a bit bizarre, some people truly believe it. Honestly, it seems like the internet is just having fun with this theory, but I’ll let you be the judge of that one.
