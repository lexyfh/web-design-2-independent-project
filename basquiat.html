    <h1>Basquiat</h1>

    <section id="about-basquiat" class="about-basquiat">
      <p>Born on December 22, 1960, Basquiat was a famous neo-expressionist artist known for his graffiti style, his signature crowns in his works, and his striking and fearless personality. While many artists such as Van Gogh did not reach peak fame until after their death, Basquiat reached a high level of recognition and fame at the age of 20. Mentored and befriended by the great Andy Warhol, they often would collaborate and create highly contrasted paintings of high fame and value. Common themes within his art were rags to riches and historically outstanding black figures often known to be heroes and saints. He gained attention from big stars like David Bowie, even briefly dating Madonna. Basquiat’s work is now highly recognizable, valued, and well-known, very much like Warhol’s artwork. But while Warhol’s work eventually ended up “mainstream”, Basquiat’s requires a deeper understanding of his personality and intentions to truly grasp his work. Basquiat’s tragic death occurred on August 12, 1988, at just 27 years old. He had become familiar with hard substances in the early 80s which had lead to his death, but his legacy lived on. His artwork to this day holds extremely high prices, Basquiat is one of the most respected and missed artists of our time.
