    <h1>Kurt Cobain</h1>

    <section class="about-kurt">
      <p>Lead singer of the classic rock/grunge band, Nirvana, was one of the most iconic and influential artists of his time. He was loved for his angst-filled music and his progressive statements and actions. He did not shy away from voicing his opinions on gay rights, homophobia, and sexism, he would often wear dresses in the 90s, and even spraypainted “God is gay” on a car just because he could. He stated one time that he wished he was gay just to anger and annoy homophobes. Sadly, this human rights, grunge activist struggled with depression and bipolar disorder. He struggled with terrible self-image and drug addiction eventually leading to him taking his own life on April 5, 1994, at the age of 27. For many fans, this did not sit right. Due to his unhealthy relationship with his wife, Courtney Love, people believed that she murdered him and that she forged Cobain’s suicide note. While this is not true, his death was confirmed to be suicide by the police, and the FBI released his death records 27 years later, people still believe it was Love’s doing. Even 28 years after his death, Nirvana is still a highly popular band, and Kurt Cobain is still loved and missed by many.
