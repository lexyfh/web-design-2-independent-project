      <h2 id="about-27">About</h2>
      <p>The 27 Club is a largely well-known urban legend in pop culture. It involves many musicians, artists, and actors who all died at the age of 27. Many of these deaths are caused by their taboo lifestyles, including drug and alcohol abuse, homicide, suicide, and vehicle accidents. It originally began gaining attention in the media in 1969-1971, during those years the rock family lost many beloved icons. The club remains a cultural phenomenon, no one knows why all these people have such a common dark fate, while some believe it is just a coincidence, others believe in a conspiracy. It has been discussed all throughout the media, from music magazines and daily press to podcasts on Spotify. Memorials, plays, and exhibits have been dedicated to those within the club as a large portion of the public is still devastated and confused by the amount of loss. It has been said that many members of the 27 Club after they passed were all found with a Bic white lighter in their pockets. Due to this speculation, white lighters have been declared bad luck or a bad omen, this is known as the White Lighter Myth. Yet the first white Bic lighter was not produced until 1973, making it impossible for these members to have been found with it on their persons. But this myth debunking still does not keep people from avoiding the lighters for fear of gaining bad luck.
